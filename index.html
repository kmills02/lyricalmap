      <h1 id="maintitle">OTHER SIDE</h1>
      <h2 class="mainsub">FROM THE GREATEST SHOWMAN</h2>

        <p class="right">Right here, right now
           I put the offer out </p>

        <p class="chase">I don't want to chase you down
           I know you see it</p>

        <p class="run">You run with me
          And I can cut you free</p>

        <p class="drudgery">Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in</p>

        <p class="colorful">So trade that typical for something colorful
          And if it's crazy, live a little crazy</p>
          
        <p>You can play it sensible, a king of conventional</p>
        <p>Or you can risk it all and see</p>


        <!--<h1>Don't you </h1>
        <h2>wanna get away from the</h2>
        <h1>same old</h1>
        <h2> part you gotta play </h2>
        <p>'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride</p>
        <p>It'll take you to the other side</p>
        <h3>'Cause you can do like you do</h3>
        <h3>Or you can do like me</h3>
        <p>Stay in the cage, or you'll finally take the key</p>
        <h1>Oh, damn! </h1>
        <p>Suddenly you're free to fly</p>
        <p>It'll take you to the other side</p>


        <p>Okay, my friend, you want to cut me in</p>
        <p>Well I hate to tell you, but it just won't happen</p>
        <p>So thanks, but no</p>
        <p>I think I'm good to go </p>
        <p>'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in</p>
        <p>Now I admire you, and that whole show you do</p>
        <p>You're onto something, really it's something</p>
        <p>But I live among the swells, and we don't pick up peanut shells</p>
        <p>I'll have to leave that up to you</p>

        <h1>Don't you </h1>
        <h2>know that I'm okay with this</h2>
        <h1>uptown</h1>
        <h2>part I get to play</h2>
        <p>'Cause I got what I need and I don't want to take the ride</p>
        <p>I don't need to see the other side</p>
        <h3>So go and do like you do</h3>
        <h3>I'm good to do like me</h3>
        <p>Aint in a cage, so I don't need to take the key</p>
        <h1>Oh, damn! </h1>
        <p>Can't you see I'm doing fine</p>
        <p>I don't need to see the other side</p>


        <p>Now is this really how you like to spend your days?</p>
        <p>Whiskey and misery, and parties and plays</p>
        <p>If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town</p>
        <p>Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns</p>
        <p>But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little</p>
        <p>Just let me give you the freedom to dream</p>
        <p>And it'll wake you up and cure your aching</p>
        <p>Take your walls and start 'em breaking</p>
        <p>Now that's a deal that seems worth taking</p>
        <p>But I guess I'll leave that up to you</p>


        <p>Well it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly</p>
        <p>So what percentage of the show would I be taking?</p>
        <p>Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action</p>
        <p>I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen</p>
        <p>I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine</p>
        <p>Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime<p>

        <h4>15</h4>
        <p>I'd do</p>
        <h3> 8 </h3>
        <h2> 12 </h2>
        <p> Maybe 9 </p>
        <h1>10</h1>

        <h1>Don't you </h1>
        <h2>wanna get away to a </h2>
        <h1>Whole new</h1>
        <h2>part you're gonna play</h2>
        <p>'Cause I got what you need, so come with me and take the ride</p>
        <p>To the other side</p>
        <h3>So if you do like I do</h3>
        <h3>So if you do like me</h3>
        <p>Forget the cage, 'cause we know how to make the key</p>
        <h1>Oh, damn! </h1>
        <p>Suddenly we're free to fly</p>
        <p>We're going to the other side</p>


        <h3>So if you do like I do</h3>
        <p>(To the other side)<p>
        <h3>So if you do like me</h3>
        <p>(We're going to the other side)</p>
        <h2>'Cause if we do we're going to the other side</h2>
